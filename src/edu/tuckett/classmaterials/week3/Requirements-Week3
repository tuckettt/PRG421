Individual: Iterator Program
Instructions:
Write a Java program (non-GUI preferred) to demonstrate the use of
Iterator.
The program should allow a user to do the following:
• Allow the reading of a collection of animal objects from an external
file.
• Output on screen the content of a collection of animal objects.
• Use Iterator to achieve these goals.
Include a brief documentation (in the code or in a separate document)
to explain the input (if any), processing and output of the program.
